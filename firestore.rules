/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data
 *              and role-based access control for administrative functions. It prioritizes
 *              authorization independence by denormalizing authorization data onto secured documents.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles; access is restricted to the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/trip_plans/{tripPlanId}: Stores trip plans; access is restricted to the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/reviews/{reviewId}: Stores reviews for a user; read is public, write is restricted.
 * - /cities/{cityId}: Stores city data; read access is public, write access is restricted to admins.
 * - /cities/{cityId}/forecasts/{forecastId}: Stores forecast data; read access is public, write is restricted to admins.
 * - /cities/{cityId}/competitor_data/{competitorDataId}: Stores competitor data; read access is public, write is restricted to admins.
 * - /seasonal_data/{seasonalDataId}: Stores seasonal data; read access is public, write is restricted to admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own user documents and trip plans.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed for non-admins.
 * - City, Forecast, CompetitorData, and SeasonalData documents are publicly readable but only writable by admins.
 * - Reviews are publicly readable, but only the review author can create/update/delete them.
 * - The rules do NOT validate the full data schema (data types, required fields) for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - TripPlan documents include the userId to allow ownership checks without additional reads.
 * - Review documents include reviewerId and revieweeId for ownership and relation checks.
